# Wanna Get Away?

## I've been asked to design the PlanMyTrip App that will obtain the weather data for more than 500 cities from a random set of latitudes and longitudes. Additionally, the app will retrieve from the user their preferred weather conditions and identify their ideal travel destinations along with nearby hotels. Once the ideal travel destinations are identified, a group of 4 cities will be chosen and a possible travel itinerary and travel route will be produced for the user. The PlanMyTrip app will be a great way to use weather data to plan the perfect trip since it will include a travel route with Google maps that has markers identifying the cities with their weather conditions and hotel information.
